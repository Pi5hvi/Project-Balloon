1) The concept of the project is as follows:

For any closed non self intersecting curve, 
if at every point along the curves surface a normal force is applied
whose magnitude is proportional to and in the same direction as the radius of curvature,
the curve should expand into a circle without intersecting itself throughout the process.

2) User interaction:

The user will be asked to provide points using a mouse thrugh which a closed loop curve will be fit.

3)What it will look like:

Once the program draws a closed curve through the points the user provides,
it should expand the curve as stated above to convert it into a circle.
The challenge here is to initially be able to fit a non self intersecting curve any points the user may provide.

We are also considering adding a button to show the normal forces acting on the curve without making it look too messy.
