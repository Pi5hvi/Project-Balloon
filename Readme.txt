The project consists of 4 butoons.

Three of the buttons are preset shapes including the Batman logo (Button 4)

The first button is used to draw custom shape. To draw a custom shape,
begin by puttting input points by clicking on the canvas.

For some reason, the input is not displayed while clicking, more debogging is required

Once you are done inputing all your point, doble click to finish and complete loop.
Please make sure the loop you create is non self intersecting.

If all goes well, the program should shrink the custom loop into a circle.

Note this feature is still a little buggy.
It may crash if the loop is too large

A seperate program to just take user points and plot a loop is attatched for refrence (Trial 3)
This is the same program that is being called in the final project,
It takes points from the user, generates arcs to attatch them (using 3 point form) and splits each arc into 10 pieces.
however, for some reason, it does not work as well in the project as it runs as standalone.

The program is by no means complete. It does everything we want it to about 50% of the time.
With a bit more debugging and refining, this program could work really well.
